# STORY-002 – AI Integration Architecture Plan

## User Story
Design an AI-first architecture approach to demonstrate strategic technology leadership.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **System Architecture Diagram**
   - Shows integration points between Laravel, React, and AI services.
   - Includes Bubble.io for low-code workflow and UI orchestration.

2. **Prototype AI Service Adapter**
   - Implemented in PHP.
   - Demonstrates abstraction principles for multiple AI providers.
   - Allows easy extension to new AI providers.

3. **Engineering Team Workflow**
   - Defines quality standards, testing approaches, and delivery metrics.
   - Supports scalable AI feature development.

## Technical Focus
- AI service integration architecture with scalability considerations.
- Team coordination protocols for AI-enhanced development.
- Business value assessment frameworks for AI feature prioritization.

## System Architecture Overview

```

Frontend (React)
├─ Dashboard & UI components
└─ Calls Laravel API endpoints for AI features

Backend (Laravel)
├─ REST API / GraphQL endpoints
├─ AI Service Adapter (PHP)
│   ├─ Interface: AIProviderInterface
│   ├─ Concrete Adapter: OpenAIAdapter
│   └─ Future Adapters: HuggingFaceAdapter, CustomModelAdapter
└─ Business Logic / DB

AI Providers
├─ OpenAI GPT API
├─ Hugging Face
└─ Custom AI models

Bubble.io Low-Code Layer
├─ Consumes Laravel AI endpoints
├─ Orchestrates workflow / UI
└─ Can integrate multiple AI providers without code

Data Flow:
React → Laravel API → AI Adapter → AI Provider → Laravel → React/Bubble

````

### Technical Decisions and Rationale

1. **Laravel Backend**
   - Chosen for robust PHP ecosystem, API support, and ease of integrating multiple services.
   - Provides RESTful endpoints that can be consumed by React and Bubble.io.
   - AI service adapter is implemented in PHP to centralize AI interactions.

2. **React Frontend**
   - Provides dynamic, responsive UI for AI dashboards and feature interaction.
   - Can consume Laravel API endpoints directly.
   - Component-based design allows incremental addition of AI features.

3. **AI Service Adapter Pattern**
   - Uses an interface `AIProviderInterface` and concrete implementations (OpenAIAdapter, HuggingFaceAdapter, etc.).
   - Abstracts away provider-specific logic.
   - Ensures scalability and allows the team to add new AI providers with minimal code changes.

4. **Bubble.io Integration**
   - Selected for rapid prototyping and workflow orchestration without heavy frontend coding.
   - Connects to Laravel API endpoints via HTTP workflows.
   - Supports AI experimentation and proof-of-concepts without impacting React app development.

5. **Testing and Quality**
   - Each AI adapter is unit-tested to validate correct API calls.
   - Integration tests ensure Laravel endpoints respond correctly to both React and Bubble.io clients.
   - Metrics like latency, success rate, and AI output accuracy are monitored.

6. **Scalability Considerations**
   - Backend architecture allows multiple AI adapters to run in parallel.
   - Bubble.io and React consume the same API, ensuring consistent behavior across different interfaces.
   - Future AI providers can be added without major changes to frontend or workflow layers.

## PHP AI Service Adapter Prototype

```php
<?php

namespace App\Services\AI;

interface AIProviderInterface {
    public function generateText(string $prompt, array $options = []): string;
    public function classifyText(string $text, array $options = []): array;
}

class OpenAIAdapter implements AIProviderInterface {
    protected $apiKey;

    public function __construct(string $apiKey) {
        $this->apiKey = $apiKey;
    }

    public function generateText(string $prompt, array $options = []): string {
        // Call OpenAI API and return text
    }

    public function classifyText(string $text, array $options = []): array {
        // Call OpenAI API for classification
    }
}
````

## Bubble.io Integration Notes

* Bubble.io triggers Laravel endpoints for AI features via HTTP workflows.
* AI responses (text generation, classification) are displayed in Bubble UI.
* Enables rapid prototyping and testing of AI features without React frontend changes.

---

## Engineering Workflow for AI Features

* **Feature Design:** Team defines AI use-case, expected outcome, and success metrics.
* **API Contract:** Laravel endpoints clearly define input/output structures.
* **Testing:** Unit tests for AI adapters, integration tests for Laravel API.
* **Quality Metrics:** Latency, accuracy, and usage analytics for AI calls.
* **Delivery Metrics:** Number of AI features implemented per sprint, prototype cycle times.
* **Team Accountability:** Code reviews, documentation standards, and shared responsibility for AI integration.

---

## Goals & Success Metrics

* Scalable AI service integration with minimal provider-specific code changes.
* Easy extension to multiple AI providers.
* Rapid prototyping with Bubble.io to validate AI features.
* Clear team workflow ensuring quality, testing, and measurable outcomes.
